## Challenge - User Story

This a description of the requirements for the application requested by the client:

- AS AN employer I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

AS A user never knowing what I want to eat I WANT to be able to input certain criteria (cuisines I don't want, distances I don't want to pass) SO THAT the app can randomly select a restaurant based off that criteria

## Challenge - Acceptance Criteria

The following criteria for the application had to be met:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio <br />
  THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down <br />
  THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation <br />
  THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work <br />
  THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application <br />
  THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications <br />
  THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices <br />
  THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Code
For this application, I wanted the website to seamlessly flow when increasing or decreasing the page size. For that, I added various media queries at various breakpoints.
